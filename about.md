#### < Coder >. Pyth<small>🐍</small>n enthusiast. Cats & dogs lover. V<small>🏐</small>lleyballer. P<small>🍺</small>b quizz goer.


I'm a simple person that enjoys coding, challenges and sleep. I believe people should never stop learning new things, because the brain also needs exercise. Also, I think the most important thing we can do for future generations is to provide them with proper education. Which is why I'm always eager to share my knowledge with anyone that wants to learn. People say I'm pretty easy going, but I have a socializing limit, after which I become a bit introvert. That's probably the reason why I love animals very much.
