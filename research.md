I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.utcluj.ro/en/">Technical University of Cluj-Napoca</a> in the field of Computer Science. My research is called "High performance processing and visual analysis on multidimensional data". The passion for this field comes from a desire to extend the human ability of analyzing big data with the computing power of machines. Particularly in the area of multidimensional data (i.e. data with more than 2/3 dimensions, which can no longer be represented on a computer screen), new techniques are needed to be able to extract information from it.

The goal of my research is to have a progressive and interactive visualization cycle for multidimensional data which can work in pseudo real-time. I'm also considering integrations with Virtual/Augmented Reality techniques, to overcome the shortcomings of 2D screen-space.
If this is something that interests you as well, or you just want to find out more, don't hesitate to contact me. For research only, please use my UTCN email address : <a href="mailto:adela.neacsu@cs.utcluj.ro"> adela.neacsu@cs.utcluj.ro </a>
